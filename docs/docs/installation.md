# Installation

CyFi requires python 3.10 or later.

If you already have python 3.10+ installed, simply run `pip install cyfi` and then head over to the [Quickstart](../#quickstart) page to learn how to generate cyanobacteria predictions.

If you don't have python installed, we strongly recommend using Miniconda. Miniconda is a tool to manage your Python environments and package dependencies. It is a lightweight version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they both depend on, and a small number of other useful packages (like pip).

Follow the instructions for your operating system below to install python (with Miniconda) and CyFi.

- [Windows instructions](#windows-instructions)
- [MacOS instructions](#macos-instructions)
- [Linux instructions](#linux-instructions)

2. Double-click the downloaded .exe file

3. Follow the instructions on the screen. If you are unsure about any setting, accept the defaults.


### Install CyFi

Once the Miniconda installation has finished,

1. From the Start menu, open Anaconda Prompt

2. Type `pip install cyfi` and hit enter

3. To check that CyFi has been installed, run `pip show cyfi`

```
$ pip show cyfi
Name: cyfi
Version: 0.1.0
Summary: CyFi is a Python package to estimate cyanobacteria density in small, inland water bodies using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery.
```

## MacOS instructions

### Install python

1. Look up your computer's chip by clicking on the apple in the top left corner of the screen, selecting "About this mac" and looking at "chip"

2. [Download the Miniconda installer](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-other-installer-links.html#macos-installers) by clicking on the link for "Miniconda3 macOS" for Python 3.10.</br>If you have an M1 chip, make sure to click on the "Apple M1" link. </br>If you have an Intel chip, make sure to click on the "Intel x86" link.
