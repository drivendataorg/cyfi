# `cyano` changelog

## v0.0.0 (2023-08)

### Previous model: Machine learning competition

The algorithms used by `cyano` v1 were based on the winning solution from the
[Tick Tick Bloom](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/143/tick-tick-bloom/) machine learning competition, hosted by [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/) and created on behalf of [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/). Data for the competition was provided by [over 30](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/143/tick-tick-bloom/page/651/#about-the-project-team) public health and water management agencies across the United States. The algorithm was developed using the [winning competition submissions](https://github.com/drivendataorg/tick-tick-bloom), with some aspects changed during development to improve performance.
